# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

Using `document.getElementById()` helped me understand how to select HTML elements by their ID tag.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?

I chose the milestone messages that would be humouros.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?

One challenge was putting the javascript right inside the HTML file.

## What personal twist did you add?

I added a twist by changing the background color at each milestone, as suggested in the assignment. Additionally, I updated the button text and page title after the first click.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

Mainly games have click-based mechanics where users tap to gain points which keeps users engaged and tricks them to continue using the app.
